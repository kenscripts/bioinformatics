# Introduction
  * a network can be constructed from features with similar behavior across samples
  * in biology, networks can be constructed from different data:
    * a co-expression network can be constructed from genes with similar expression patterns across samples
    * a co-abundance network can be constructed from amplicon sequence variants/otus with similar abundance profiles across samples
  * networks can identify correlations; differential network analysis can identify changes in networks between phenotypes

# Workflow
   * choose correlation measure
